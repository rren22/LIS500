			Hi! My name is Rachel Ren and I am a junior studying Information Science. Some of my interest are listening
			to music, playing games, and watching shows. I took this class because I want to learn more about HTML and
			web development. My favorite 'tech' thing is my gaming keyboard.

			My Name is Nsikan Morgan, I am an Information Science major, and I am from Milwaukee Wisconsin. My favorite
			tech thing is the Apple Vision Pro. I like the Apple Vision pro because even though the technology isn't
			really that good in the present day, I have seen the potential of what it will be in 5 - 10 years when the
			goggles are lighter and have more functions.
