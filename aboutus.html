			<h2>Rachel Ren</h2>
			Hi! My name is Rachel Ren and I am a junior studying Information Science. Some of my interest are listening to music, playing games, and watching shows. I took this class because I want to learn more about HTML and web development. My favorite 'tech' thing is my gaming keyboard. One hero that currently inspire me is Alan Turning.

			<h2>Nsikan Morgan</h2> 
			My Name is Nsikan Morgan, I am an Information Science major, and I am from Milwaukee Wisconsin. As of right now I don't really have a tech hero. My favorite tech thing is the Apple Vision Pro. I like the Apple Vision pro because even though the technology isn't really that good in the present day, I have seen the potential of what it will be in 5 - 10 years when the goggles are lighter and have more functions.
