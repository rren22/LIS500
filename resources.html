		<h2>Our Thoughts of Implicit Bias</h2>
		Implicit bias refers to our unconscious stereotypes that affect our understanding and decisions without us
		realizing it. It shapes our experiences, cultures, and society norms and can affect how we interact with
		different groups of people. Intersectionality is when two or more factors of a person's being overlap,
		causing a whole new set of challenges for that person. For example, a black woman will experience unique
		challenges solely because she is black and but she will also experience a whole other set of problems solely
		because she is a woman. Intersectionality is also when the challenges of her being black and the challenges
		of her being a woman overlap, creating a whole new set of challenges unique only to black womens.
