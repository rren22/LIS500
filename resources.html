	<h2>Our Thoughts of Implicit Bias</h2> 	<!!-- Our Thoughts on Implicit Bias -->
	<p>
		Implicit bias refers to our unconscious stereotypes that affect our understanding and decisions without us realizing it. It shapes our experiences, cultures, and society norms and can affect how we interact with different groups of people. Intersectionality is when 2 or more factors of a person's being overlap, causing a whole new set of challenges for that person. For example, a black woman will experience unique challenges solely because she is black and but she will also experience a whole other set of problems solely because she is a woman. Intersectionality is when the challenges of her being black and the challenges of her being a woman overlap, creating a whole new set of challenges Unique only to black women.
